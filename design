CSC 174: Assignment 10
Due Date: Monday, December 11, 2017
Design Document
Name: L & A Adventures
Mood: come look at the places we have travelled to and the foods we have eaten there
Fonts: Every webpage should have a slightly different font to “bring” the user into the country
 Oswald is something that is used in many other travel blogs.
 Overall use Sans serif
 Japan: light airy, something more of the cute side
o Ubuntu
o Noto Sans
 New Zealand: very bloggy feel to this one but modern at the same time
o Oswald
o Droid Sans
 France: look prestigious; reminds me of the classic times
o Montserrat
o PT Sans Narrow
 Canada: old-fashioned font mixed with a bubbly feel
o Raleway
o Open Sans Condensed
 Korea: looks like the Korean alphabet- loopy with straight lines
o Roboto
o Lato
Visuals:
 Orange and Gray
o Orange to give it a pop of color (fun, exciting)
o Gray to add a bit more sophistication in the webpage (after all you are trying to get the
user’s attention of saying that we are a good source of information on travelling)
 Most focus on Z pattern for each webpage
 Homepage- more of a F-pattern in terms of listing information of each place
 Pick a wordpress theme that gives a modern, blog-like feel
